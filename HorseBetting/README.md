# Horse Betting
This project as a collaboration of ideas between a high school friend and myself. </br>
My friend approached me with an idea for predicting horse races and refered me some articles about analytical methods for horse betting. </br>
Note: these files may not run due to backwards compatability (written a while ago)

## Approach
A simple model is used to predict horse races. </br>
7-8 parameters are used in a perceptron-like model to predict a horse's score. </br>
The scores of all horses in a race are compared and the highest score is the predicted winner.

## Technologies
- Python
- Pandas: for dataset load, cleaning, etc
- Tensorflow: Machine Learning framework to train the model
